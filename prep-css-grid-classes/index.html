      <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
      <p>
        Raiders of the Lost Ark was rleased in 1981 and directed by Stephen Spielberg,
        written by Lawrence Kasdan, with story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman. George
        Lucas was inspired by serial adventure films like Buck Rogers, Zorro's Fighting Legion,
        and Spy Smasher that he enjoyed in his youth, and Raiders of the Lost Ark is essentially
        a modernized take on those movies.

      <h3>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</h3>
      <p>
        Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released in 1984 and is a sequel to
        Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was directed by Steven Spielberg, written by
        Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, and story by George Lucas. The film is much darker
        in tone compared to the previous film (attributed to the turmoil and breakups
        Lucas and Spielberg experienced during filming) which also led to the creation of
        the PG-13 MPAA rating and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is one of the first
        films to carry such a rating.

      <h3>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</h3>
      <p>
        Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was released in 1989 and is the third film in the
        Indiana Jones series. It was directed by Steven Spielberg, written by Jeffrey Boam,
        with story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes. After Indiana Jones and the Temple of
        Doom, Spielberg choose to tone down the violence and dark themes for this film. It also
        has more comdedic elements compared to any of the previous films.
